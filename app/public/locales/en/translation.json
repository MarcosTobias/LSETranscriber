The idea behind separating the web from the service is for being able to use them separately. Both are open source, so if you are interested, jump to the <1 href='https://github.com/MarcosTobias/LSETranscriber'>GitHub</1> repo! And if you don't want to extend the application, don't worry. The trained model for sign recognition is uploaded as well.",
